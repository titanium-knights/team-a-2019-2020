<p>This 2019-2020 OpMode illustrates the basics of using the Vuforia localizer to determine positioning and orientation of robot on the SKYSTONE FTC field. The code is structured as a LinearOpMode When images are located, Vuforia is able to determine the position and orientation of the image relative to the camera. This sample code then combines that information with a knowledge of where the target images are on the field, to determine the location of the camera. From the Audience perspective, the Red Alliance station is on the right and the Blue Alliance Station is on the left. Eight perimeter targets are distributed evenly around the four perimeter walls Four Bridge targets are located on the bridge uprights. Refer to the Field Setup manual for more specific location details A final calculation then uses the location of the camera on the robot to determine the robot's location and orientation on the field.</p>
